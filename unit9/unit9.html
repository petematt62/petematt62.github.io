	<h1>Reflection</h1>

    <textarea>

Which existing websites out there most inspired your web site design thus far?
  I was most inspired by brainpop.com.

Which parts of the design are you most proud of?
  The combination of css and javascript that does the resizing of the canvas elements.

What struggles did you encounter in your design process?
  I was most perplexed by the canvas element.  You can't use css to resize it and the process of saving its data and redrawing the canvas does not work well.  I finally decided to use a two-part solution: one for screen size variation on-load, and one for screen resize on-fly.

What did you learn from making your project responsive?
  A bunch about the canvas.  It doesn't resize well.  Tons of javascript.  There are ways to create web page objects when events happen..so you can add (and subtract) elements from the web page.

 FIRST

Review a website from group 1 (https://medium.com/),commenting on each website's layout, typography, navigation, and overall flow.

  I picked medium.com because there was an awesome photo of the milky way on the first thing I looked at on the page.  The page layout is like:

layout.

col1          col2                               col3                  col4

blank         content: stories                  blank                 tags and clickable
              another story                                           odd navigation style
............................................

typography.

  The entire site uses a simple sans-serif font with some variation in size and boldness.  Each of the stories in column 2 (col2) have their own font, determined by the author of the story.  The only Serif font is the company name/logo on the first line of column 1, "Medium".
............................................

navigation.

  There is a traditional nav bar at the top center of the site with "staff pics", "top stories", and "bookmarks".  There is additional navigation in column 4 (col4) in which users can click on tag values to see stories filtered for a specific topic.  Users can also chose to write a story in a few places.
.............................................

overall flow.

  I did not feel like there -was- a flow. However, I -did- see the first story AND chose to review the site based on the art in that story.  The site is broken into four vertical columns.  I do not think it was designed to have a strong flow.  The site is at the mercy of the stories that are submitted -- each with different fonts, different art, colors, etc.  

SECOND

Review a website from group 2 (http:http://cavs.mit.edu/),commenting on each website's layout, typography, navigation, and overall flow.

  I picked http://cavs.mit.edu/ because there was some wild graphics going on. The page layout is like:

layout.

col1       col2      col3        col4       col5        col6       col7      col8      col9

main       anim.     anim.       anim.      hero       2ndary     anim.      empty   empty
nav        quote     image       image      cartoon    nav        
..........................................

typography.

The site uses the same sans-serif font throughout.  Differences in weight, size, and color are used to determine hierarchy.
............................................

navigation.

The site uses non-traditional navigation.  There is a small "Go to_" in the upper left corner that opens into a drop down selection nav bar.  There are seven other places where the text is blued to indicate hyperlinks.  The hero image is the title for the site, and it is also the blue of a hyperlink.  "Difficult"
.............................................

overall flow.

I did not experience the overall flow of the site.  The large number of columns (9), each having an outline border, really breaks up any flow.  Also, there are some pretty distracting animations continually playing, so what flow??
